## Workshop on Reproducible Research

### Preparations

In [Activity 3](../Activity3), we will be creating an R Markdown
document, which mixes text and code to make a fully reproducible
report.

You will first need to install,
[R](https://cran.rstudio.com),
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), and
some R packages. It's best to have the *latest* versions, so if you
installed them in the distant past but haven't updated them recently,
please re-install them.


### Windows

- [R](http://cran.rstudio.com): Download and run
  [R-3.3.3-win.exe](https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/R-3.3.3-win.exe)

  Download and run
  [RStudio-1.0.136.exe](https://download1.rstudio.org/RStudio-1.0.136.exe)

- Start RStudio, and at the R prompt (the pane with the `>`
  character), type:

      install.packages(c("rmarkdown", "formatR", "ggplot2"))

### Mac OS X

- [R](http://cran.rstudio.com): Download and run
