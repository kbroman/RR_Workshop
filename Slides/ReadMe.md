## Slides for Workshop on Reproducible Research

These are slides for a one-hour workshop on Reproducible Research,
created to be part of the
[Data Science and Plant Breeding Simulation Workshop](http://plantsciencesymposium.umn.edu/workshop/schedule)
at the University of Minnesota on 23 March 2017.

Here are the compiled versions:

- [pdf with notes](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/presentations/rrworkshop_2017-03_withnotes.pdf)

These slides are based on slides for a talk that I've given quite a number of
times. Here's the most recent version of the full talk:
